I have reviewed the code for the BookingController and BookingRepository.

I refactored the BookingController code, addressing several key points:

1. I introduced error handling by implementing a Try-Catch block.
2. Removed unnecessary variable initializations that were not being used in the code.
3. Suggested using roles and permissions to manage admin and super admin IDs in the database instead of storing them in the .env file.
4. Improved the code for handling failed responses.

Regarding the BookingRepository, my findings after refactoring some portions of the code are as follows:

1. The Repository file was overly large, and the code lacked proper organization, leading to code duplication.
2. There were repetitive if blocks with the same conditions, and nested if blocks were not structured optimally.
3. I recommended using Laravel's `filled` method for better validation instead of manually checking `isset`, `is_null`, and `empty`.
4. Error handling was missing in the repository file, along with basic-level validations that could enhance the code.
5. Inconsistent syntax for arrays was used, such as `$resp = array();` and `$resp = []`. It's advisable to maintain a consistent coding convention.
6. The code could benefit from breaking down functions to improve readability and efficiency.
7. Suggested separating the query building logic into smaller, more manageable parts.
8. Encouraged using Eloquent relationships instead of manual joins to enhance code readability.

I allocated approximately 2-4 hours to this task, focusing on refactoring rather than optimizing the code. For the `willExpireAt` method, I created a Laravel unit test. Given the scope of this task and the time available, I believe one unit test is sufficient to validate the method's functionality and compare the results with the expected output.
